using solid work , the characteristics of the robot including mass, moment of inertia and dimensions of the robot was extracted.
Attached a coordinate device to each of the robot's links and the parameters of Denavitâ€“Hartenberg were achived.
Obtained the final actuator position and its rotational position in terms of joint angles.
Extracted fixed angles, Euler angles, axis-equivalent and quadrilateral angles for the final robot operator according to its joint coordinates.
Obtained the robot workspace (drawing in 3D space) by Using direct kinematic calculations and drwaing was done in simulink.
Solving the inverse kinematics of the robot and extracting its joint coordinates according to the linear and rotational positions of the final operator, also Checking the correctness of the result by inputting the direct kinematic response.
Calculating the Jacobian matrix of the robot using at least two different methods and comparing the results.
Specify the singularities of the robot and checked them in terms of position and orientation. Also discussion of the physical state of the robot at these points were made.
The dynamic of the robot was be calculated by the  Lagrange method. Also matrices C, M and G related to the dynamics of the robot were extracted.
